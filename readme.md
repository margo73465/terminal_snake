### Python Python!
A python implementation of the classic snake game for your terminal. It's still a work in progress here are some immediate and reach goals. 

##### Basic Improvements:

* allow a user to restart after game over
* make the snake get faster as it eats apples
* give the user multiple lives
* sound?

##### Possible Future Diresctons:

* get it on the web somehow....
* create a 2 player version  
  (the goal would be to trap your opponent so they hit themself or the wall)
* record high scores  
  (only really makes sense in web version)
